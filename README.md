## About

[GitEmoji](https://gitemoji.com) is a guide to standardize and explain how to use **emojis on GitHub commit messages**.

**Using emojis** on **commit messages** provides an **easy way** of **identifying the purpose or intention of a commit** with only looking at the emojis used. As there are a lot of different emojis but also a lot of emojis guides, we found the need of creating a guide in our way that can help to use emojis easier.

## Example of usage

In case you want integrate emojis in your project, here's an example of a practical way to use it :

```
<message> :shortcode:
```

- `message:` Brief commit message explaining your changes.
- `shortcode:` String that will add the emoji chosen next to your message.

## Contributing to GitEmoji
